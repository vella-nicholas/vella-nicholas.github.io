## Chronicles of the Developer
As a Software Developer, I come across various blogs with a plethora of invaluable information. In assistance to our community I have put together a collection of resources that I use to keep myself updated with the latest news and technology trends.

### Blogs with high update frequency
These blogs are updated on a daily or weekly basis.

### Blogs with slow update frequency
These blogs are updated on a monthly basis (or even more). Entries are usually longer and more fleshed out.

### Cheat Sheets
- [Visual Studio Code: Keyboard shortcuts for Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf){:target="_blank"}

### Git Aliases
```
alias ga='git add '; 
alias gaa='git add -A '; 
alias gb='git branch '; 
alias gc='git commit '; 
alias gcm='git commit -m '; 
alias go='git checkout '
```
