## Chronicles of the Developer

As a Software Developer, I come across various blogs with invaluable amounts of knowledge and information. This is a collection of resources I use to keep myself updated with the latest news and technology trends.

### Blogs with high update frequency

These blogs are updated on a daily or weekly basis.

### Blogs with slow update frequency

These blogs are updated on a monthly basis (or even more). Entries are usually longer, with more fleshed out examples.
